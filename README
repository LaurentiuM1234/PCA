============================ DISCLAMER ====================================
(*) all the images used to train and test the application were not mine
and I have provided the source of them in the section "Bibliografie" of
the "Documentatie.pdf" file.

============================ DESCRIPTION ==================================
(*) this project was realised with the following goals in mind:
	- better understand basic linear algebra concepts.
	- understand how PCA works and how it's able to classify images.
	- test the performances of the PCA algorithm.

(*) the project represents an implementation of the PCA algorithm used to
classify a set of given images, using another set of images for training. 

(*) more details regarding the project are provided in the
"Documentatie.pdf" file (written only in romanian).
